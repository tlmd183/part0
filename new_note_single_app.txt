    browser->>server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
    send the new note as JSON data containing both the content of the note (content) and the timestamp (date) to server
    server-->>browser: status code 201 created
    deactivate server

    The Javascript code takes the input and registers an event handler that prevents the date to be sent to the server.
    Event handler then creates new note, adds it to notes list and then send new note to the server.
